📊 Python Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of focused, real‑world analytics projects completed using Python. Each script highlights a specific skill: data cleaning, visualization, geospatial analysis, time‑series exploration, and validation techniques. Together, they demonstrate a clear, structured approach to solving analytical problems across diverse datasets.
📁 What’s Inside
A curated set of 12+ mini‑projects, each with a clear purpose:

Olympics participation trends

Election spending analysis (2016–17)

Death Records demographic insights

Custom age‑bin visualizations

Reusable percentage‑distribution function

Ice‑cream product review filtering

Flights dataset extraction

Iowa Liquor Sales sampling

Geospatial point mapping with GeoPandas

Data validation & verification methods

Each file is named to reflect its analytical goal and can be read independently.

🔍 Highlight: NYC Taxi Parade Analysis
One of the standout analyses explores how the 2015 Thanksgiving Day Parade affected taxi pickups along the parade route.

Key idea:  
By combining timestamps, geospatial coordinates, and event timing, the analysis shows how road closures influenced pickup density during the parade window.

This project demonstrates time‑series filtering, mapping, and event‑based reasoning.

🧪 How I Validate Results
Across all projects, I use consistent quality‑checking techniques:

Solving problems using two different methods

Using visual diagnostics (histograms, plots, maps) to spot anomalies

Comparing manual counts with DataFrame shapes

Testing sensitivity by adjusting filters and time windows

These steps ensure accuracy, reliability, and analytical rigor.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas)
